# ts_deep_dives

Educational implementations of fun software tools in TypeScript.

## Actively working on:

- **oranguru**: TypeScript implementation of the Monkey language from [_Writing an Interpreter in Go_](https://interpreterbook.com/). Also referencing ["An Introduction to Efficient and Safe Implementations of Dynamic Languages"](https://stefan-marr.de/2020/06/efficient-and-safe-implementations-of-dynamic-languages/).

## In my learning queue:

### Projects

- **nit**: TypeScript implementation of Git. Reference: [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/) (originally in Ruby)

- **bittorrent client**: Originally in [JavaScript](https://allenkim67.github.io/programming/2016/05/04/how-to-make-your-own-bittorrent-client.html)

- **graph db**: [Dagoba](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/dagoba-an-in-memory-graph-database.html).

- **Regex Engine**: Originally in [JavaScript](https://deniskyashif.com/2019/02/17/implementing-a-regular-expression-engine/)

### Books/Notes

- [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)

## Why TypeScript?

1. I find that translating books from one programming language to another forces me to really focus on what the code is doing. When I use the same language as the reference, I can get away with copy-paste coding. 

2. I really enjoy programming in TypeScript.

3. I can take some artistic license in writing an "idiomatic" solution in the target language. This is stimulating/makes me feel clever. This is also why I refer to this process as translation, as opposed to transliteration.

4) This is a good opportunity to get familiar with more Node.js apis. I want to make more Node.js tools, and reimplementing existing tools will surely give me some ideas. ts_deep_dives already birthed [sPool](https://github.com/tjkandala/sPool), so I'm excited to see the quality of tools I create after I finish ts_deep_dives.

## Why are they all in the same repo?

These projects are not at all intended to be production-ready or to provide any value over existing implementations. They will still feature comprehensive test suites and documentation for skills development. I will move any library that I think provides value over its competitors to its own repo (like [Baahu](https://github.com/tjkandala/baahu)).
